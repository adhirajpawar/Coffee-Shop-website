<h2>Summary</h2>  
<p>I have developed a frontend-only coffee shop website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is designed to provide an engaging and visually appealing experience for visitors. It includes several key sections such as the homepage, menu, about us, and contact. The homepage offers a welcoming introduction to the coffee shop, featuring highlights and promotions. The menu section displays a variety of beverages and food items, complete with descriptions and prices. The about us section provides information about the coffee shop's history and values, while the contact section includes a form for visitors to get in touch, along with the shop's address, phone number, and social media links. The design is modern and clean, with responsive layouts to ensure it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
Although the current version of the project focuses solely on the frontend, future enhancements are planned to add backend functionalities. These enhancements will include features such as order management, user authentication, and database integration to handle menu items, orders, and user information. This project showcases my skills in creating an interactive and user-friendly interface, demonstrating proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By incorporating future backend development, the website will offer a complete and functional solution for a coffee shop's online presence.</p>
